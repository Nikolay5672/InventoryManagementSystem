Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application developed as part of a Sirma Academy project. It provides a structured approach to managing inventory, processing orders, and handling payments efficiently.

Key Features:
Item Management: Add, remove, and view items with details such as name, category, price, quantity, and additional attributes (e.g., warranty for electronics, expiration date for groceries).
Order Processing: Users can create, view, and cancel orders, with automatic quantity updates for purchased items.
Payment Handling: Supports cash and card payments, storing transaction records.
File-Based Data Storage: Items, orders, and payments are stored in files, enabling persistent data management.
The system provides an interactive menu-driven interface for seamless user interaction and is designed to simulate real-world inventory management scenarios.
